Comment[Submitted Name]	Analysis of compartment-specific gene expression in breast cancer tumors
Experiment Description	Triple-negative primary breast cancer tumors, rich in inflammatory stroma, were laser microdissected and global mRNA expression was analyzed in stroma compartment, cancer cell compartment, and in total tumor tissue. Three FFPE breast cancer tumors wer laser microdissected and the cancer cell and stroma compartments were collected. A piece of t

Protocol Description	The data were analyzed using expression console software version 1.1.2 using default analysis settings and RMA as normalization method. ID_REF =  VALUE = log2 GC-RMA signal	Biotinylated cDNA were prepared according to the SensationPlus FFPE Affymetrix protocol from approximately 100 ng total RNA (SensationPlus FFPE Amplification and WT labeling kit User guide, 2012, Affymetrix).	Following fragmentation, 6 ug of cDNA were hybridized for 17 hr at 47C on GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST array in GeneChip Hybridization Oven 645. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA FFPE kit	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner 3000.
Protocol Type	normalization data transformation protocol	labelling protocol	hybridization protocol	nucleic acid extraction protocol	array scanning protocol
